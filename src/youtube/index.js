/**
 * Two API pollers, nothing else.
 *
 *   uploads  playlistItems.list — new videos, Shorts and streams all appear here
 *   pending  videos.list        — watch a scheduled stream flip to live
 *
 * Both cost 1 quota unit per call. There is deliberately no HTML scraping:
 * this container is served throttled and unparseable pages by youtube.com,
 * which is what made an earlier scrape-based probe post unrelated channels'
 * videos into Slack.
 *
 * Several channels are watched, and the uploads poll takes ONE of them per
 * tick rather than all of them. playlistItems accepts a single playlist per
 * call, so polling every channel every tick would multiply quota by the number
 * of channels — six channels at 30s is 17,280 units/day against a 10,000/day
 * ceiling. Round-robin keeps the cost flat and pays for it in latency: any one
 * channel is checked every uploadsPollSeconds x channelCount. Scheduled
 * streams don't suffer for it — once discovered they move to the watchlist,
 * which is polled for every channel at once (videos.list takes 50 ids per
 * unit) and so keeps its full precision at the moment of go-live.
